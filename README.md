# SmartTraffic
Simulate a traffic intersection and apply intelligent traffic configurations.
Personal project to learn and practice C++, unit testing, and code documentation processes.

Goals: 
  1. Unit test during development, not after
  2. Document code during development, not after
  3. Write code with scalability in mind
  4. Modularize code in case of future desired design changes
